# Welcome

Thank you for your interest in this project. Even though it is far from ready, I do believe it will have a positive impact on many people's security and secret handling in PHP projects.

Feel free to join this effort as the project just started and there are many things I need to complete before it can be a valuable project for the PHP community.

Since this is an early stage project, my main goal is to offer a seamless service with the [1Password Connect API](https://support.1password.com/connect-api-reference/), similar to the other supported technologies offered by 1Password.
